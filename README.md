### Exploration of sentiment trends and key discussion topics across multiple subreddits using Natural Language Processing, comparing data from 2019 to the present.

### **Key question: Are people angrier these days ?**
Determine the tendency of negative feelings among people in the world by analyzing the sentiment of comments on Reddit. We will compare comments from 2019 to those from the present across 40 subreddits. Our aim is to identify whether comments have become more negative or positive over time and uncover the key words frequently used in discussions.

### Limitations :
- Kaggle dataset limited to May 2019
- Scraped data limited to within days of scrape time and power

  
### For future analysis, we recommend : 
- Adjusting the scraping technique to get comment data from other years.
- Taking a deeper look at the content of the comments.
- Creating a proper training set to fine-tune the model in order to predict other emotions.
- Focusing on a single subreddit to analyze trends within a smaller community.
